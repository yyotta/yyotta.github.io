## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Multi-step Reasoning for Complex Visual Problems under Data Constraints** | *NSFC General Program*
*Core Researcher* | Jan. 2026 - Dec. 2029
*   Designing a multimodal knowledge subspace adaptive optimization method based on gradient decoupling to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of MLLMs in complex multimodal scenarios.
*   Employing orthogonal constraints on cross-domain subspaces to decouple the learning of domain-specific and general knowledge, improving the reasoning capability of MLLMs in complex cross-domain tasks.

**Step-level DPO for MoE LLMs in Multi-domain Continual Learning** | *Xiaomi Research Fund*
*Lead Student Researcher* | May 2025 - Jul. 2026
*   Designed a Step-level Direct Preference Optimization method for self-training, utilizing the LLM’s intrinsic capabilities to evaluate and generate step-level preference data.
*   Constructed an adaptive expert collaboration mechanism that dynamically fuses knowledge subspaces, improving MAA by 14.99% and BWT by 10.58% on CoIN.
*   The proposed KSS-MoE framework was **accepted by AAAI 2026** [1].

**Multimodal Intelligent Continuous QA via Dynamic Knowledge Graph-based RAG** | *CCF-Zhipu AI Fund*
*Core Researcher* | Nov. 2024 - Nov. 2025
*   Proposed a MoE-based framework tailored for multi-domain continual learning, leveraging shared knowledge representations to facilitate positive cross-task knowledge transfer.
*   Mitigated the router collapse issue prevalent in vanilla routing networks, ensuring effective expert collaboration.
